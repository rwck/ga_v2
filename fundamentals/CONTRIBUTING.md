# Contributing to Fundamentals

## Getting Started

Fundamentals is a [GitBook](https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook).

GitBook can be installed from NPM using:

```
$ npm install gitbook-cli -g
```

Install Gitbook plugins

```
$ gitbook install
```

Run a local copy at http://localhost:4000 with:

```
$ gitbook serve
```

Chapters are written in markdown files and compiled down to HTML inside `_book`

To build the static website use:

```
$ gitbook build
```

> Warning! Inline code blocks ie single back ticks are not properly escaping HTML entities.
> To work around this use `<code>`

```
<code>"This works"</code>
`"This doesn't"`
```
