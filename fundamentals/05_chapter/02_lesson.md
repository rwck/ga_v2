# Functions

## Defining JavaScript Functions

To create a new function, we must *declare* it as we would a variable.  A **function declaration** typically looks like this:

```javascript
function nameOfMyFunction(x) {
  // Body of the function 'nameOfMyFunction';
}
```

As you can see, the first line begins with the word `function` followed by `nameOfMyFunction`, which is how we'd like to refer to that function later.

Next, we write a list of the input values we'd like to use, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas. These values are called **parameters** of the function.  Above, we only used one parameter, `x`.

Finally, we write the body of our function, enclosed by a pair of curly braces (`{}`).

Let's look at an example:

```javascript
function tripleIt(x) {
  return 3 * x;
}
```

This function takes one parameter – `x`. The body of the function consists of one statement that says to return the parameter of the function (that is, `x`) multiplied by 3.

This is the first time we're seeing a `return` statement – it does exactly what it sounds like it does. `return` gives back the output of the function.

###Naming Functions

Function names should describe what the function does as best as possible, and a general rule of thumb is to keep the name short and simple.

You may have noticed how we capitalize names in JavaScript using the **camelCase** style. Remember that identifiers *(how we name things)* can't use spaces between them.

To make it easier to read a name like `nameofmyfunction`, capitalize the first letter of each word (e.g. `nameOfMyFunction` – see the resemblance to a three-humped camel?)

Examples of naming functions:

- **bad**:  `thisfunctioncalculatestheperimeterofarectangle` (no camelCase, too verbose)
- **bad**:  `my new function` (contains spaces)
- **bad**:  `myNewFunction` (doesn't explain what it does!)
- **good**: `calculatePerimeter` (describes what it does, short, and uses camelCase)


## Calling JavaScript Functions

Declaring a function does not execute the instructions we include in its body. After declaring, we've simply given the function a name and specified how it should work when it is given a set of parameters.

To actually *evaluate* a function, we have to **call** that function as follows:

```javascript
nameOfMyFunction();
```

In the case of `function tripleIt(x)`, if we wanted to call the function by passing the value 4, we would write:

```javascript
tripleIt(4)
```

> **NOTE**: The number `4` used when the function is called is known as an **argument**.

The function would execute its statements and evaluate to the value `12`.

Just like a variable, we can use the return value of this function in any expression. For example:

```javascript
var a = tripleIt(1);                         // a === 3
var b = 100 * tripleIt(4);                   // b === 1200
var c = 200 + (tripleIt(20) / tripleIt(10)); // c === 202
```


### Test Yourself

Suppose that we've defined the function 'glorp' as follows:

```javascript
function glorp(someNumber) {
  return someNumber * 5 - 3;
}
```

What will each of the following expressions evaluate to?
* glorp(10)
* 2 * (glorp(5) + 10)
* glorp(1 + 2)
* glorp(glorp(1))

Test your answers in repl.it by copying the function definition into the editor, clicking the 'play' button, and typing each of these expressions into the console.

## The Return Statement

As mentioned above, `return` specifies the value of the function when it's executed. It has another important job - it tells the function to immediately stop whatever it's doing.

Consider the following program:

```javascript
function doAThing(x) {
  if (x > 10) {
    return x + 10;
  }
  return x;
}
```

If `x` is greater than 10, the computer will run the `if` statement and hit that first `return` statement (`x + 10`).

This will *immediately end the function* - that second `return` statement won't be reached.

### Test Yourself

Where will the function stop if `x` is 5? 10? 20? What value will be returned in each case?

```javascript
function categorize(x) {
  if (x < 8) {
    return 8;
  }
  x += 3;
  if (x < 15) {
    return x;
  }
  return 100;
}
```
