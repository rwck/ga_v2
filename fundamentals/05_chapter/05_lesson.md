#Functional JavaScript

Functions can also be used as procedures – miniature, self-contained programs that are executed one line at a time whenever the function is called.

When you have a set of tasks that need to be repeated, it can often be helpful to turn that set of tasks into a function, and call it every time that the procedure should be run.

For instance, let's go back to the "French Toast a la GA" recipe from Unit 4. Every time a soaked slice of bread is ready to be cooked, we need to:


> 5: Transfer the slices to your frying pan and cook on a medium-low heat until brown on the bottom.
>

Rather than writing out explicitly how this should be done each time, we could write a function, (say `cookSoggyBread()`) to handle this set of instructions for us, and simply call that function any time the bread slices need to be cooked.

## Problem Solving with Functions

Let's look at a practical example. Say that we're working on a [TicTacToe game](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe).

We're not going to build the actual game, just write out the logic that would determine the winner.

In TicTacToe, there are nine possible values (for every cell on the board):

```
| a | b | c |
| d | e | f |
| g | h | i |
```

Each of these values will start as `null`, until a user assigns them a new value, either 'o' or 'x'

To play around with this invisible TicTacToe board, we've provided some code:

```javascript
function cellValue(key) {
  switch(key) {
    case 'a': return null;
    case 'b': return null;
    case 'c': return null;
    case 'd': return null;
    case 'e': return null;
    case 'f': return null;
    case 'g': return null;
    case 'h': return null;
    case 'i': return null;
    default : return null;
  }
}
```

To assign a value (`x`, `o`) to any cell on the board, edit the return value for the corresponding case.  For example, if you want the board to read:

```
| null | null |   x  |
| null |   o  | null |
| null |   o  |   x  |
```

You would edit the switch statement like such:

```javascript
function cellValue(key) {
  switch(key) {
    case 'a': return null;
    case 'b': return null;
    case 'c': return 'x';
    case 'd': return null;
    case 'e': return 'o';
    case 'f': return null;
    case 'g': return null;
    case 'h': return 'o';
    case 'i': return 'x';
    default : return null;
  }
}
```

###Who is the Winner?

Now, let's write a function that determines the winner based on the values of a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, and i.

We'll call it `getWinner` and it will give us back either 'x' (if X has won), 'o' (if O has won), or `null` (if neither side has won).

```javascript
function getWinner() {
}
```

So where do we go from here?

One way to determine the winner might be to check whether X has won and then to check whether O has won. What if two functions existed that would magically determine this for us?

We could call them `winnerIsX` and `winnerIsO`.  `winnerIsX` could give us back `true` if X has won and `false` if it hasn't. If such functions existed, we could rewrite `getWinner` like this:

```javascript
  function getWinner() {
    if (winnerIsX()) {
      return 'x';
    }
    if (winnerIsO()) {
      return 'o';
    }
    return null;
  }
```

OK! Now we're getting somewhere. Instead of solving one big problem, we're solving two smaller problems – how do we determine whether X or O won?

###Determing if `x` has won

Let's focus on `winnerIsX` first.

In TicTacToe, there are three ways that X can win:
1. All cells in a row contain an `x`
2. All cells in a column contain an `x`
3. All cells in a diagonal contain an `x`

Wouldn't it be great if we had functions to determine these too? We could call them `winsRowX`, `winsColumnX`, and `winsDiagonalX`.

In this case, X would win if there were a row victory OR a column victory OR a diagonal victory, so to determine `winnerIsX` we could write the following:

```javascript
function winnerIsX() {
  return winsRowX() || winsColumnX() || winsDiagonalX();
}
```

You can't execute anything yet.  Just stick with us – we only have a few more tiny problems to solve!

####Winning by Rows

Let's look at `winsRowX` – what does it actually mean to win a row?

According to our cell key from earlier, there are three cells in a row; the first row is `a`,`b`, and `c`; the second row is `d`,`e`, and `f`; the third row is `g`,`h`, and `i`.

If any of these three sets are all equal to `x`, then X has won via a row.

Let's dive just one level deeper, with a function to test if any one of the three rows are equal to `x` (let's call it `allThreeX`).

```javascript
function winsRowX() {
  return allThreeX(cellValue('a'), cellValue('b'), cellValue('c')) ||
  		allThreeX(cellValue('d'), cellValue('e'), cellValue('f')) ||
  		allThreeX(cellValue('g'), cellValue('h'), cellValue('i'));
}
function allThreeX(cellOne, cellTwo, cellThree) {
}
```

####Winning by Columns and Diagonals


We can also use `allThreeX` to write functions for `winsColumnX` and `winsDiagonalX`. This would give us the following code:

```javascript
function getWinner() {
  if (isWinnerX()) {
    return 'x';
  }
  if (isWinnerO()) {
    return 'o';
  }
  return null;
}

function isWinnerX() {
  return winsRowX() || winsColumnX() || winsDiagonalX();
}

function winsRowX() {
  return allThreeX(cells('a'), cells('b'), cells('c')) ||
         allThreeX(cells('d'), cells('e'), cells('f')) ||
         allThreeX(cells('g'), cells('h'), cells('i'));
}

function winsColumnX() {
  return allThreeX(cells('a'), cells('d'), cells('g')) ||
         allThreeX(cells('b'), cells('e'), cells('h')) ||
         allThreeX(cells('c'), cells('f'), cells('i'));
}

function winsDiagonalX() {
  return allThreeX(cells('a'), cells('e'), cells('i')) ||
         allThreeX(cells('c'), cells('e'), cells('g'));
}

function allThreeX(cellOne, cellTwo, cellThree) {
}
```

Now that we've broken it into one much smaller problem, our `allThreeX` function is fairly easy to write!

```javascript
function allThreeX(cellOne, cellTwo, cellThree) {
  return (cellOne === 'x') && (cellTwo === 'x') && (cellThree === 'x');
}
```

Excellent! Now, `isWinnerX` should be able to tell us if X has won.

###Determining if `o` has won

Now, we could go ahead and start writing a function called `allThreeO` to do the same thing for O as we've done for X. But that seems pretty duplicative.

There's a principle we'll emphasize in this course – one that is so universally agreed upon an that it has a name. The principle is this: if you find yourself writing almost the exact same code in two places, take a moment to figure out how you can reorganize. We often refer to this concept as writing "DRY" code – with "DRY" standing for "Don't Repeat Yourself". In this case, we're considering writing two functions which would be exactly the same, except for that hard-coded value of 'x' vs 'o'. Wouldn't it better if we could make the function `allThreeX` more general so that it worked for both players?

Let's see what we can do.

```javascript
function allThree(player, cellOne, cellTwo, cellThree) {
  return (cellOne === player) && (cellTwo === player) && (cellThree === player);
}
```

###Removing the duplicative code

Now `allThree` can be used to test for `x` **or** for `o`; by getting rid of our hard-coded data, we were able to make this function do double-duty!

Let's do the same thing for all the other functions we wrote:

```javascript
function getWinner() {
  if (winnerIs('x')) {
    return 'x';
  }
  if (winnerIs('o')) {
    return 'o';
  }
  return null;
}

function winnerIs(player) {
  return winsRow(player) || winsColumn(player) || winsDiagonal(player);
}

function winsRow(player) {
  return allThree(player, cells('a'), cells('b'), cells('c')) ||
         allThree(player, cells('d'), cells('e'), cells('f')) ||
         allThree(player, cells('g'), cells('h'), cells('i'));
}

function winsColumn(player) {
  return allThree(player, cells('a'), cells('d'), cells('g')) ||
         allThree(player, cells('b'), cells('e'), cells('h')) ||
         allThree(player, cells('c'), cells('f'), cells('i'));
}

function winsDiagonal(player) {
  return allThree(player, cells('a'), cells('e'), cells('i')) ||
         allThree(player, cells('c'), cells('e'), cells('g'));
}

function allThree(player, cellOne, cellTwo, cellThree) {
  return (cellOne === player) && (cellTwo === player) && (cellThree === player);
}
```

If you want, you can play around with this code in [this repl.it session](http://repl.it/aOU), which also contains some dummy code to mock up how `cells` might work. Try testing each of the different functions with different input values, and see what happens.

Have fun!
