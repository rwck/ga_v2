You may have noticed that we neglected to include Antarctica in the `World` directory.

Go ahead and correct this mistake straight from command line:

1. Open up the terminal application

2. Change to the `World` directory within your home directory

3. Make a new directory titled "Antarctica" inside the `World` directory

4. To be sure you created the directory in the right place, list the contents of the `World` directory

5. If you haven't already, change back into the `World` directory

6. List the contents of `South_America`. There should be three country directories, Argentina, Brazil, and Chile.

7. Move the contents of `South_America` into the `North_America` folder

8. Delete the now empty `South_America` directory

9. Change the name of `North_America` to `Americas`
