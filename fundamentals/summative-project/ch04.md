## Project

Let's use what we've just learned about flow control to make some more progress on our 'Rock Paper Scissors' project.

Go back to `RockPaperScissors.js`, and scroll down to the following code:

```javascript
  function getWinner(playerMove,computerMove) {
      // This function should either give us back 'player', 'computer', or 'tie'.
      // The rules of the game are that rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock.
      // Assume that the only possible input values we can get are 'rock', 'paper', and 'scissors'.
  }
```

This time, we'll be using flow control to determine which value gets `return`ed: either 'player' (if the player wins), 'computer' (if the computer wins), or 'tie' (if it's a draw).

If you're feeling stuck, take a look back at Chapter 3 (Expressions). What expression could we write to tell us if the player (or computer) has won? What expression could tell us if there was a tie?

Once you've finished (and have tested your code), commit the changes you've made to the project's repository.
