## Project

Now that we've learned a little bit about expressions, let's apply some of this material to our 'Rock Paper Scissors' project.

---

Go back into the project repo, wherever you've decided to put it, and open up the file `RockPaperScissors.js` (inside the `app/js` directory).

When you look inside the file you should first see a block of code that looks like this :

```javascript
function getInput() {
    console.log('Please choose either "rock", "paper", or "scissors".');
    return prompt();
}

function randomPlay() {
    var randomNumber = Math.random();
    if (randomNumber < 0.33) {
        return 'rock';
    } else if (randomNumber < 0.66) {
        return 'paper';
    } else {
        return 'scissors';
    }
}
```

We recommend you don't edit this code right now, but feel free to look at it closely and try to figure out how it works - learning to read code is an important step in learning how to write code.

When you're ready, skip ahead to the next section, shown below.

```javascript
function getPlayerMove(move) {
    // Write an expression that operates on a variable called `move`
    // If a `move` has a value, your expression should evaluate to that value.
    // However, if `move` is not specified / is null, your expression should equal `getInput()`.
    return /* Your Expression */;
}

function getComputerMove(move) {
    // Write an expression that operates on a variable called `move`
    // If a `move` has a value, your expression should evaluate to that value.
    // However, if `move` is not specified / is null, your expression should equal `randomPlay()`.
    return /* Your Expression */;
}
```

Similar to how you've done this in your exercises, you will need to replace the `/* Your Expression */` comment with an expression of your own creation. Instructions for how this expression should behave are laid out in the single-line comments above.

> **CAUTION** For now, if you don't understand the `getInput()` or `randomPlay()` functions, you can safely ignore that stuff for now - we'll be covering all of that in depth in Chapter 5. Just focus on subbing in your new expressions.

Go ahead and get started - once you've finished editing those two lines, save your code and make a commit to your project's repository.
