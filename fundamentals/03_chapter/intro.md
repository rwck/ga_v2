#####By the end of this Unit, you'll be able to:
* Perform arithmetic and logical operations on data to produce new values
* Concatenate two strings together in JavaScript
* Write expressions that both assign and evaluate variables.
* Explain what Null is and (generally) how it works.
* Recognize the difference between 'truth-y' and 'false-y' values

# JavaScript

So far, you've learned the basics of:
- how to create and edit files via the command line
- how to track changes in your projects using git
- how to share those projects with the world by publishing them on GitHub.

Now it's time for us to move on to the main event: programming.

It's worth mentioning that although most people think of programming as being about writing code, it's really much more about solving problems. Problems such as:

- "How many students are here today?"
- "How far away am I from the restaurant?"
- "What's the fastest way to find the file I'm looking for?"

Trying to "just start coding", without first figuring out the problem at hand is a surefire way to waste time, frustrate yourself, and create sub-optimal products. However, in order to understand how to solve a problem, you first need to understand the tools at your disposal.

In the rest of this chapter, we'll be exploring some of the more common tools and concepts a programmer needs to understand. Although we will be specifically looking at these concepts in the context of **JavaScript**, these tools (or similar ones) are present in nearly every modern programming language. Having a strong understanding of these basics is incredibly important, and will translate to your work in other languages, whether you end up working in JavaScript, Ruby, Python, or any other language.

## Repl.it
To start playing around with JavaScript, we'll be using a website called **[Repl.it](http://repl.it/languages/JavaScript)**.

As you can see in the screenshot above, repl.it features two main windows. On the right, with the black background, is the *console* - this tool (much like the Terminal on your computer) will accept a single instruction from the user and attempt to run it when the user hits "enter". On the left, with the white background, is the *editor*. The editor allows us to write several instructions in sequence; to execute these instructions, click the 'play' button near the top.

To save your repl.it session, just click the 'save' button in the upper right - it'll generate a URL that you can bookmark and come back to any time you want.
