##![Your Turn](../assets/exercise.png) Your Turn

Follow [this link](http://repl.it/9km) to some sample code in a repl.it session - it should contain the following code:

```javascript
/* Your Expression Here */
```

This thing is called a *comment* - it tells the computer to completely ignore everything between the two `/` characters. There are two kinds of comments: **multi-line** comments (`/* comment */`), which can run across multiple lines, and 'single-line' comments (`// comment`), which only comment out everything following it on the current line.

1. Replace `/* Your Expression Here */` with an expression that evaluates to the integer `30`.
You can use any expression you like, but it must contain at least one (and ideally two or more) operations. You can test your answers by clicking the play button at the top of the page - it will spit out the evaluated result of your expression into the console.

** Note ** Ensure the *type* of this result is correct - Remember `30` and <code>'30'</code> are not the same!

2. Now replace your first expression with a second expression - this one should evaluate to 'Hello World'.

3. Finally, replace the previous expression with an expression that evaluates to the boolean `true`. Try using two or three operations for this one!
