##![Your Turn](../assets/exercise.png) Your Turn

Follow [this link](http://repl.it/hhf) to some sample code in a repl.it session - it should contain the following code:

```javascript
var x;
/* Your Expression */
```

As in the previous exercise, your job is to replace the `/* Your Expression */` comment with an expression. However, this time your expressions will need to depend on the variable `x`.

1. Write an expression that evaluates to 10 more than `x`;<br>
if `x` is 10, the expression should evaluate to 20;<br>
if `x` is 50, the expression should evaluate to 60.<br>
Test your answer by changing the first line to `var x = someValue;` and clicking the 'play' button.

2. Now replace that first expression with an expression that evaluates to triple the value of `x`, plus five;<br>
if `x` is 5, the expression should evaluate to 20;<br>
if `x` is 10, the expression should evaluate to 35.<br>
What happens if you set `x` to 100? Does it work like you'd expect?

3. Next, replace that expression with one that evaluates to "Hello, x.";<br>
if `x` is "Alice", the expression should evaluate to "Hello, Alice.";<br>
if `x` is "Bob", the expression should evaluate to "Hello, Bob.".

4. Finally, replace the prior expression with one that evaluates to "Goodbye, x.";<br>
if `x` is "Charlene", the expression should evaluate to "Goodbye, Charlene.";<br>
if `x` is "David", the expression should evaluate to "Goodbye, David".

Try testing out all of the different "test cases" mentioned above.
If they all give you the answers that you expect, you're done!
