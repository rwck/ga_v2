##![Your Turn](../assets/exercise.png) Your Turn

Here's a link to some [sample code](http://repl.it/agR) on repl.it :

```javascript
var checkerboard = [[null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null],
                    [null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null],
                    [null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null],
                    [null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null],
                    [null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null],
                    [null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null],
                    [null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null],
                    [null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null]];

function setSquare(player, row, col) {
  // Your Code Here
}

function getPieceAt(row, col) {
  // Your Code Here
}
```

In this exercise, we'll be laying the groundwork for a Checkers game. Your task is to implement two functions:
* `setSquare`, which places a player (either 'R' or 'B') at a particular row and column on the board.
* `getPieceAt`, which returns the piece at a particular row and column; if there's no piece at that position, it should return `null`.

Be sure to save your repl.it session - we'll be using it in a later exercise.
