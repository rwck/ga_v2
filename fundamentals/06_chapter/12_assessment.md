**WDI Fundamentals Unit 6**

---

As of the last time you worked on `wdi-fundamentals-rps`, you should have the following working functions:
  * `getPlayerMove` which (unless a move is provided as a parameter) prompts the user for input
  * `getComputerMove` which (unless a move is provided as a parameter) generates a random move for the computer
  * `getWinner` which takes two parameters (representing the player's and computer's moves, respectively) and evaluates to either 'player', 'computer', or 'tie' based on the moves that the player and computer are making.
  * `playToFive` which runs the Rock Paper Scissors game until either the player or the computer has won five times.

Now it's time to submit the project.

## Submit your work!

The final step to your project assignment is to submit a link to your repository. Since your repository is public, we'll be able to review the code that you've written and anyone will be able to add comments to it.

Let's get started!

1. `push` your code up to your remote repo on GitHub.com, using the command `git push origin student`. You'll need to make sure you've committed all your changes before pushing.

  > *At this point, if you visit your GitHub repository on the web, you should see the code that you've written.*

2. Submit a link to your Github repository via [this form](https://ga-immersives.typeform.com/to/IUDmkL).

That's it for now!

#### Well done! You've made it through six tough tutorials on JavaScript. Give yourself a pat on the back!

Now that you've finished your project, we encourage you to [learn more about GA Mentors](../07_feedback/intro.md), and connect with a mentor to get feedback on your code before your course begins.
