**WDI Fundamentals Unit 2**

#####By the end of this Unit, you'll be able to:
* Define a version control system and its benefits
* Describe how Git works
* Identify the Git commands used to set up a local respository and to record 'snapshots' of your project
* Push local changes to a remote repository using the command line

#Version Control

When you’re working on a project – say a painting, a piece of software or an autobiography – there comes a time when you wish you had a reset button.

You might already have a system in place to deal with this problem – maybe you save your document multiple times with different names, so that you can return to a different stage of the project.

Developers call this process “version control”.

If you're making copies of a file every time you make a change, your file system might look like this:

While this method works (kinda), it has a number of major limitations.
* It only allows you to track changes in one file; if your project consists of multiple files, you're out of luck.
* It's extremely duplicative - before long, you might end up with 10, 20, or even 50 slightly-different copies of the same file.
* It's extremely difficult (if not basically impossible) to see what has changed from one version to the next without opening each file and comparing changes line by line.
* Keeping track of parallel versions (revision A vs revision B) is possible, but it's hard to compare one to the other, and integrating the two verions is a lot of work.

Now imagine how much more complicated this process becomes once you start working with a team...

Software developers have developed a number of tools to solve the 'version control' problem for their own projects; in this course, we will focus on one particularly popular version control program called **Git**. Git addresses all of the problems mentioned above:
* Git tracks changes for multiple files by keeping them all in **repositories** - special directories with some hidden Git machinery.
* Rather than saving entire separate versions of each file, Git keeps a record of the *changes* that have been made to each file - much more space-efficient.
* Because Git stores changes, rather than whole files, looking at what's changed from one iteration to the next is very easy.
* Git allows you to easily keep track of parallel versions of a project using a feature called **branching**. We won't cover this feature now, but you'll be using it a lot once you start the course.

Git is also an excellent tool for working collaboratively on a project, though we won't be using those features right away.

##Installing Git

If you don't already have Git, you can install it by downloading the latest release from [git-scm.com](http://git-scm.com/download/mac), double-clicking the downloaded file, and going through the installer.

> **HINT** As with any software installation, it’s always good to backup your system and data before proceeding.

You can check to see if it worked by opening up the terminal and typing:

```
$ git --version
```

This will show you what version of Git is running; your computer should return something greater than or equal to `2.0.0`:
