**WDI Fundamentals Unit 4**

---

#####By the end of this Unit, you'll be able to:
* Use conditional statements to control the flow of program execution
* Use loops to repeat an operation or action based on the value of a condition

In the previous unit, we spent some time writing very simple programs - sets of instructions that were interpreted by our computer one at a time, in order. Kind of like a recipe, no?

Suppose, however, that we were trying to cook something a little more complicated. For example, consider the following excerpt from "French Toast a la GA"
> ...
>
> 3: Whisk eggs, milk, honey and kosher salt until eggs are no longer visible.
>
> 4: Dip your bread slices in the custard. If you're using a pre-sliced loaf, and the slices are thin, a short dip (just enough to coat both sides) should be enough; however, if your slices are thick, you may want to give the bread a minute or two to soak up the custard.
>
> 5: Transfer the slices to your frying pan and cook on a medium-low heat until brown on the bottom.
>
> ...

Instructions like these require the cook to make decisions based on available data; in the context of programming, this is called **control flow**, because it specifies the flow of the computer's actions through the program.

In this unit, we will look at how control flow gets implemented in JavaScript; in particular, we'll be focusing on making decisions (conditionals) and repeated behavior (loops).
