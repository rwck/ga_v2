##Your Turn

Follow [this link](http://repl.it/9nF) to some sample code in a repl.it session - it should contain the following code:

```javascript
var x;
var result;
/* YOUR CODE HERE */
```

This exercise may be familiar to some of you - your job is to write some code that, depending on the value of `x`, assigns one of several values to `result`:

* If `x` is evenly divisible by 3 (for example, 3, 6, or 9), set `result` to "fizz".
* If `x` is evenly divisible by 5 (for example, 5 or 10), set `result` to "buzz".
* If `x` is evenly divisible by both 3 and 5 (for example, 0 or 15), set `result` to "fizzbuzz".
* If `x` is not evenly divisible by either 3 or 5 (for example, 7), set `result` to `x`.

> Don't remember how to determine if something divides evenly? Look back at Chapter 3 (Expressions) and take a look at the modulus (`%`) operator.

To test your code, set a value for `x` in the editor and click 'play'. Did you get the result you expected? Try out a bunch of different values for `x`, just to be sure.
