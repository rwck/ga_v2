Dear WDI Student,

Congratulations on joining the Web Development Immersive program at General Assembly!

We hope you find WDI to be as rewarding as it is challenging â€” we can assure you it will be both. There are a lot of technical ideas to cover and terms to learn, and being unprepared can easily trip you up. To make sure you have the proper footing, we've prepared this ebook covering the fundamentals of web-based programming. These concepts will come up throughout the course, and becoming familiar with them before the course begins will help set you up for success.

The entire ebook is six units long and we expect it to take you around 40 hours to complete it.

[Ok, let's get started!](00_chapter/get_started.md)
