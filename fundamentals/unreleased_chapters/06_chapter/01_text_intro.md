## Objectives

* Gain exposure to the power at your fingertips
* Get excited about web development

## Outline

We've taken a thorough look at some of the core fundamentals of programming in
the context of Ruby. You must be asking yourself, "All this is well and good,
but what is something that I can actually _do_ with these skills? I want to do more than just build text-based apps on the command line!"

For a brief moment, we are going to abandon our pursuit of mastery of our craft
(only for a moment) to get a glimpse of the power that you will soon be wielding. For the sake of this unit, do not worry about
understanding everything that you are asked to do. However, pay attention to
following these instructions _precisely_. With a little patience, and some
attention to detail, simply marvel at the ease with which you (yes, **you**) can
spin up an application that exists on the internet!

> Our goal for this unit is to create a web application that allows the users to
> enter a search term and see a list of movies that match the search term.
